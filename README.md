# C - printf

In this project, my teammate Amine Khammessi and I created our  own _printf() function that works exactly like the standard library's printf() from scratch. 

## Description
_printf() is a function that produces output according to a format.
Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c: for characters 
s: for strings 
%: simply prints %
d: for double int 
i: for integers
ELSE: prints the the charcater as is to the stdout
